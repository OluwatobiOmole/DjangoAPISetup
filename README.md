# Django REST Framework (DRF) API Example

This project demonstrates how to create a RESTful API using Django and Django REST Framework (DRF). It includes features like model creation, serialization, and endpoint development.

## **Features**
- Create, read, and manage resources using RESTful API endpoints.
- Database model (`Drink`) with fields for `name` and `description`.
- Serialization of data to and from JSON using DRF's `ModelSerializer`.
- Function-based views for handling HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE').
- Basic API routing using Django's `urlpatterns`.
